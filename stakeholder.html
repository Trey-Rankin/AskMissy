<h1>The Stakeholder</h1>
    <h3>Who are they? Why do they care? Why does it make life easier?</h3>
<div style="background-color:white;width:50%;margin:auto;border:1px solid black">
<ul>
	<li><b>Students (grades 9-12)</b></li>
		<ul><li>Students need the best tools at their disposal when it comes to researching the world around them.</li>
    <li>Students in grades lower than 9-12 may have difficulty navigating the website.</li>
    <li>Students in grades higher than 9-12 may have more experience with finding specific books, leading to having less need for this tool.</li></ul>
	<li><b>Teachers/Tutors</b></li>
		<ul><li>Being able to make specific recommendations to students and get immediate feedback on the effectiveness of a resource is invaluable to teachers and tutors.</ul></li>
	<li><b>Booksellers/E-book Stores</b></li>
		<ul><li>Booksellers/E-book stores could be losing potential customers and profit that they would otherwise get if it was simpler and easier for readers to know which books to get.</li></ul>
	<li><b>Libraries</b></li>
		<ul><li>More people would sustain their library memberships, as they would continually have books recommended towards them that fit their liking.</li></ul>
  <li><b>School Districts</b></li>
  	<ul><li>School Districts would be able to measure the rate at which their students are actively reading and participating in scholastic endeavors both in school and out.</li></ul>
