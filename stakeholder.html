<h1>The Stakeholder</h1>
    <h2>Who are they? Why do they care? Why does it make life easier?</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Students</b></li>
		<ul><li>Students need the best tools at their disposal when it comes to researching the world around them.</ul></li>
	<li><b>Teachers/Tutors</b></li>
		<ul><li>Being able to make specific recommendations to students and get immediate feedback on the effectiveness of a resource is invaluable to teachers and tutors.</ul></li>
	<li><b>Booksellers/E-book Stores</b></li>
		<ul><li>Booksellers/E-book stores could be losing potential customers and profit that they would otherwise get if it was simpler and easier for readers to know which books to get.</li></ul>
	<li><b>Libraries</b></li>
		<ul><li>More people would sustain their library memberships, as they would continually have books recommended towards them that fit their liking.</li></ul>
