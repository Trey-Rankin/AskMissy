    <h2>Who are they? Why do they care? Why does it make life easier?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Booksellers/E-book Stores</li>
		<ul><li>Booksellers/E-book stores could be losing potential customers and profit that they would otherwise get if it was simpler and easier for readers to know which books to get.</li></ul>
	<li>Libraries</li>
		<ul><li>More people would sustain their library memberships, as they would continually have books recommended towards them that fit their liking.</li></ul>
