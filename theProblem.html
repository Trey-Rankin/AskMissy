<h3>How are they Suffering?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Students find it difficult to find resouces that work well with thier learning style</li>
	<li>Students have too many options when it comes to finding resources - there needs to be a way of narrowing down resources to fit the needs of the student. (specifically designed around you and your personal preferences)</li>

</ul>
<h3>Why are they Suffering?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Some students may not have good teachers and tutors to guide them to find resources</li>
	<li>Students are not aware of where they can find physical copies of resources</li>
	<li>Students may not be aware of what kind of learning style they have</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is cost?</h3>
<p>An inefficient or outdated resource search engine could lead to inaccurate results or a student may waste time using multiple searches to get a result. If a reader does find a resource but realizes it doesn't fit their learning style or preferences upon already reading it, they may feel unmotivated to learn. Money is a concern to those who buy hardcopy books or E-books where they are nonrefundable. So AskMissy seeks to connect students with existing resources at their local libraries.
