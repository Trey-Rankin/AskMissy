    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Students' performance is not optimized because of a lack of matericals tailored to their personal
    learning preferences.
    <h3 style = "text-align: left; color: black">Problem Flow</h3>
    <p>When a student searches for reference material on thier own they can be overwhelmed by the number of options
    and can be hit with 'analysis paralysis'.
    <img src="problem_flow.PNG" alt="Problem Flow Diagram">
    <p>Once a student has found a resource ther is no guarentee that the resource whould match their learning style.
    Therefore they must once again begin their search.</p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>The AskMissy software application will help students find the resources necessary for
    them to bridge the gap between conventional and digital learning for a more personalized experience.
    </p>
    <h3 style = "text-align: left; color: black">Solution Flow</h3>
    <p>Rather than be faced with too many search options at once, the student can now do to AskMissy and input their details
    in a personalized profile to not only find a resource for their current subject, but find resources based on their preferences.
    </p>
    <p>AskMissy  will learn from the responses of the users, so that every time AskMissy finds a book, the results and feedback will make the next search even better.</p>
