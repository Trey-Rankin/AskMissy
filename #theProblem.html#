  <h1>The Problem</h1>
  
<h2>The wide range of genres and subjects of books lead to indecisiveness and a loss of would-be readers</h2>
<h3>Who is Suffering?</h3>
<p>Avid readers and anyone interested in reading</p>
<h3>How are they Suffering?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Readers find it difficult to find books that they want to read.</li>
	<li>Readers have too many options when it comes to finding books - there needs to be a way of narrowing down books to fit your needs and interests. (specifically designed around you and your personal preferences)</li>
	<li>Readers find it difficult to find books to represent themselves or their ideals, especially individuals who are underrepresented in literature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why are they Suffering?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Choosing a book requires more insight and takes more time</li>
	<li>Harder to pinpoint specific taste/preference with so many options</li>
	<li>Worry of not liking the book leads to indecisiveness</li>
	<li>The reader has no knowledge of literature that matches their preferences i.e. is inclusive and represents them in a respectful manner</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is cost?</h3>
<p>An inefficient or outdated book search engine could lead to inaccurate results or a reader may waste time using multiple searches to get a result.
If a reader does find a book but realizes it doesnâ€™t fit their intended search criteria or preferences upon already reading it, they may feel at a loss in the time invested.
Money is a concern to those who buy hardcopy books or E-books where they are nonrefundable.
Buyer: Opportunity to increase profits for commercial retailers, publishing and printing companies.
